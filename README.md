# Has It Blown Over

Built for [PubHack #1](http://pubhack.co.uk) where the theme was "Post-Apocalypse".

We collate Twitter reports of zombie outbreaks (using the hashtag `#pompeyzombie`), and plot them in real-time on a map to help our would-be heroes to navigate their new zombie-infested world: avoiding dangerous areas and seeking refuge in safe zones.

And in true Shaun of the Dead style, we have a button to show the near-by pubs where you can "wait for this to blow over".
